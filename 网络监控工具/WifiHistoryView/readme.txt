Description
===========

WifiHistoryView is a simple tool for Windows 11/10/8/7/Vista that
displays the history of connections to wireless networks on your
computer. For every event that the computer connected to a wireless
network or disconnected from it, the following information is displayed:
The date/time that the event occurred, network name (SSID), profile name,
network adapter name, BSSID of the router/Access Point, and more...
WifiHistoryView can read the wifi history information from a running
system or from external event log file of another computer.
You can also view the wifi history of remote computer on your network, as
long as you connect the remote computer as Administrator.



System Requirements
===================

Ths utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows Vista
and up to Windows 11. Both 32-bit and 64-bit systems are supported.
Previous versions of Windows (Windows XP and earlier) are not supported.



Source of Information
=====================

WifiHistoryView loads the Wifi history information from the
'Microsoft-Windows-WLAN-AutoConfig/Operational' event log of Windows.
This even log is usually stored in the following file:
C:\windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Microsoft-Windows-WLAN-AutoConfig%4Operatio
nal.evtx
